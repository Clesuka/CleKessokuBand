          <h2>後藤 ひとり</h2>
          <h3>Gotō Hitori/Bocchi</h3>
          <p>
            The lead guitarist of Kessoku Band. An extreme introvert who has
            trouble with most social interactions. Having been inspired by her
            father, she learned how to play guitar in her first year of middle
            school, thinking this would help her make friends. Despite becoming
            incredibly skilled at playing guitar and having a small fanbase
            online (under the alias "guitarhero"), she still has not been able
            to make friends as easily until she was dragged into playing with
            Kessoku Band. Since then, Hitori has gained a few friends and is
            learning to interact with other people. She is usually seen wearing
            a pink tracksuit, which she even wears over her school uniform. Her
            surname comes from Masafumi Gotoh.

          <h2>伊地知 虹夏</h2>
          <h3>Nijika Ijichi</h3>
          <p>
            The drummer and founder of Kessoku Band. Her older sister, Seika,
            runs a live house where they often play. Nijika looks up to Seika,
            since they lost their mother at a young age and their father
            disappeared. She's very kind, cheerful, friendly and outgoing, and
            is the one holding the group together and helping Bocchi with her
            social anxiety the most. Her surname comes from Kiyoshi Ijichi.

          <h2>山田 リョウ</h2>
          <h3>Ryō Yamada</h3>
          <p>
            The aloof, quiet and mischievous bassist of Kessoku Band with a cool
            demeanor and an androgynous appearance, to the point she sometimes
            attracts other girls (including Ikuyo) without intending to. She
            often spends what allowance she gets from her family on new music
            equipment, which leaves her with little money for anything else, to
            the point of eating weeds when she has no money for food. After
            having a falling out with her last band over creative differences,
            Ryo was convinced by Nijika to start a new one with her. Her surname
            comes from Takahiro Yamada.

          <h2>喜多 郁代</h2>
          <h3>Ikuyo Kita</h3>
          <p>
            The vocalist and secondary guitarist of Kessoku Band, who attends
            the same high school as Hitori. In contrast to Hitori, she is a
            cheerful, charismatic extrovert who has an active social life, to
            the point that her extroversion manifests as an overwhelming aura at
            times. She initially joined Kessoku Band to get closer to Ryo, whom
            she has a crush on, but fled after lying about her guitar playing
            skills. With Bocchi's help, she becomes a decent guitar player in
            her own right, and soon settles on playing secondary guitar and
            providing the band's main vocals. Her surname comes from Kensuke
            Kita.
